//Generate an Array of All Object Keys with Object.keys()

/*
We can also generate an array which contains all the keys stored in an object using 
the Object.keys() method and passing in an object as the argument. This will return 
an array with strings representing each property in the object. Again, there will 
be no specific order to the entries in the array.
