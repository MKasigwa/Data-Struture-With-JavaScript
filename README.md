# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures, you'll learn the fundamentals of :
* JavaScript including variables, 
* arrays, 
* objects, 
* loops, 
* and functions.

Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).


# Lecon 4 : Debugging 
Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

Issues in code generally come in three forms: 
* Syntax errors that prevent your program from running, 
* Runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior and 
* Logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen. 

This section contents 11 Lecons (files): 
1. Debug1 : Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
2. Debug2 : Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
3. Debug 3 : Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names
4. Debug 4 : Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes
4. Debug 5 : Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes
5. Debug 6 : Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator
6. Debug 7 : Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call
7. Debug 8 : Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function
8. Debug 9 : Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing
9. Debug 10 : Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop
10. Debug 11 : Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition
