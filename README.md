# Data-Struture-With-JavaScript


# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures, you'll learn the fundamentals of :
* JavaScript including variables, 
* arrays, 
* objects, 
* loops, 
* and functions.

Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).

# Lecon 2 : ES6

ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including :
* let and const, 
* arrow functions, 
* classes, 
* promises, and 
* modules.

# Lecon 4 : Debugging 
Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

Issues in code generally come in three forms: 
* Syntax errors that prevent your program from running, 
* Runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior and 
* Logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.
